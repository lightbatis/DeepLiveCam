## How do I install it?


### Basic: It is more likely to work on your computer but it will also be very slow. You can follow instructions for the basic install (This usually runs via **CPU**)
#### 1.Setup your platform
-   python (3.10 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) 
-   [visual studio 2022 runtimes (windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
#### 2. Clone Repository
    https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git

#### 3. Download Models

 1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
 2. [inswapper_128_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx)

Then put those 2 files on the "**models**" folder

#### 4. Install dependency
We highly recommend to work with a  `venv`  to avoid issues.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### DONE!!! If you dont have any GPU, You should be able to run roop using `python run.py` command. Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.

### *Proceed if you want to use GPU Acceleration
### CUDA Execution Provider (Nvidia)*

1.  Install  [CUDA Toolkit 11.8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)

pip install onnxruntime-gpu==1.16.3

```

3.  Usage in case the provider is available:

```
python run.py --execution-provider cuda

```

```

## How do I use it?
> Note: When you run this program for the first time, it will download some models ~300MB in size.

Executing `python run.py` command will launch this window:
![gui-demo](instruction.png)

Choose a face (image with desired face) and the target image/video (image/video in which you want to replace the face) and click on `Start`. Open file explorer and navigate to the directory you select your output to be in. You will find a directory named `<video_title>` where you can see the frames being swapped in realtime. Once the processing is done, it will create the output file. That's it.

## For the webcam mode
Just follow the clicks on the screenshot
1. Select a face
2. Click live
3. Wait for a few seconds (it takes a longer time, usually 10 to 30 seconds before the preview shows up)

![demo-gif](demo.gif)

Just use your favorite screencapture to stream like OBS
> Note: In case you want to change your face, just select another picture, the preview mode will then restart (so just wait a bit).


Additional command line arguments are given below. To learn out what they do, check [this guide](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/Advanced-Options).
